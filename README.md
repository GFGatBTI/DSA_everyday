1. Given a Binary Tree, print Left view of it. 
2. Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.
3. Given an array A of integers of length N. You need to calculate factorial of each number.
4. Smallest positive integer that cannot be represented as sum.
5. Square root of a number: Given an integer x, find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(âˆšx).
6. Count Inversions : Given an array of integers. Find the Inversion Count in the array. 
7. Search in a row-column sorted Matrix : Given a matrix of size n x m, where every row and column is sorted in increasing order, and a number x. Find whether element x is present    in the matrix or not.
8. Next higher palindromic number using the same set of digits : Given a palindromic number N in the form of string. The task is to find the smallest palindromic number greater      than N using the same set of digits as in N.
9. Is Sudoku Valid : Given an incomplete Sudoku configuration in terms of a 9x9  2-D square matrix(mat[][]) the task is to check if the current configuration is valid or not where    a 0 represents an empty block.
